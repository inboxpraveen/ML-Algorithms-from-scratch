## What is XGBoost?

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an **optimized distributed gradient boosting library** that has become the go-to algorithm for winning machine learning competitions. It's essentially gradient boosting with powerful enhancements that make it faster, more accurate, and more robust.

**Real-world analogy**: 
If gradient boosting is like a team of specialists correcting each other's mistakes, XGBoost is like that same team but with:
- A strict coach (regularization) preventing overconfidence
- Better coordination (second-order optimization)
- Smart resource allocation (column subsampling)
- Early retirement for tired members (early stopping)

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Algorithm Type** | Ensemble Learning (Advanced Boosting) |
| **Learning Style** | Supervised Learning |
| **Primary Use** | Regression, Classification, Ranking |
| **Base Learners** | Regularized decision trees |
| **Key Principle** | Second-order Taylor approximation with regularization |

### The Core Idea

```
"XGBoost = Gradient Boosting + Regularization + Second-Order Optimization + Engineering"
```

XGBoost improves upon standard gradient boosting through:
- **Second-order optimization**: Uses both gradient and hessian (curvature)
- **Regularization**: L1 and L2 penalties prevent overfitting
- **Advanced tree building**: Better split finding and pruning
- **System optimization**: Parallel processing, cache optimization
- **Flexibility**: Custom loss functions, missing value handling

### Key Improvements Over Standard Gradient Boosting

**1. Second-Order Taylor Approximation**
```
Standard GB: Uses only first-order gradient
XGBoost: Uses both gradient and hessian (second derivative)

Why better?
- More accurate direction for optimization
- Better approximation of loss function
- Faster convergence
```

**2. Regularization**
```
Standard GB: No built-in regularization
XGBoost: L1 (Lasso) + L2 (Ridge) regularization

Loss = Training Loss + Ω(trees)
where Ω = γT + ½λΣ(w²) + αΣ|w|

Benefits:
- Prevents overfitting
- Produces simpler trees
- Better generalization
```

**3. Improved Split Finding**
```
Standard GB: Tries all possible splits
XGBoost: Weighted quantile sketch + sparsity-aware algorithm

Benefits:
- Faster training
- Handles large datasets
- Optimized for sparse data
```

**4. Column Subsampling**
```
Borrowed from Random Forest
Each tree uses random subset of features

Benefits:
- Reduces overfitting
- Faster training
- More diverse trees
```

**5. Shrinkage and Column Subsampling**
```
Multiple levels of randomness:
- Row subsampling (subsample)
- Column subsampling per tree (colsample_bytree)
- Column subsampling per level (colsample_bylevel)
- Column subsampling per split (colsample_bynode)
```

## How XGBoost Works

### The Algorithm in 6 Steps

```
Step 1: Initialize predictions (base_score)
         ↓
Step 2: For each boosting round:
         a. Calculate first-order gradients (g)
         b. Calculate second-order gradients (h) - Hessian
         ↓
Step 3: Row subsampling (if subsample < 1.0)
        Column subsampling (if colsample_bytree < 1.0)
         ↓
Step 4: Build tree using regularized objective:
        For each node, find best split by maximizing:
        Gain = 0.5 × [G_L²/(H_L+λ) + G_R²/(H_R+λ) - (G_L+G_R)²/(H_L+H_R+λ)] - γ
         ↓
Step 5: Calculate leaf weights:
        w* = -G/(H+λ)
         ↓
Step 6: Update predictions:
        F(x) = F(x) + η × tree(x)
         ↓
Repeat Steps 2-6 for n_estimators
```

### Visual Example: Regression with XGBoost

Let's predict house prices with improved optimization:

```
Data:
x (size):  [1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000] sqft
y (price): [100,  180,  240,  280,  350]  k$

XGBoost vs Standard Gradient Boosting
```

**Iteration 0: Initialize**

```
Standard GB:
  F₀(x) = mean(y) = 230

XGBoost:
  F₀(x) = mean(y) = 230  (same initialization)
  
Current predictions: [230, 230, 230, 230, 230]
Residuals: [-130, -50, 10, 50, 120]
```

**Iteration 1: Build First Tree**

Standard Gradient Boosting:
```
Calculates: gradient = pred - y = [130, 50, -10, -50, -120]
Fits tree to: -gradient = [-130, -50, 10, 50, 120]

Split found: x ≤ 1750
  Left:  mean(-gradient) = -90
  Right: mean(-gradient) = 60
```

XGBoost (Enhanced):
```
Calculates both:
  Gradient (g): [130, 50, -10, -50, -120]
  Hessian (h):  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  (for squared loss)

For split x ≤ 1750:
  Left:  G_L = 180, H_L = 2
  Right: G_R = -180, H_R = 3

Gain calculation (with λ=1, γ=0):
  Gain = 0.5 × [180²/(2+1) + (-180)²/(3+1) - 0²/(5+1)] - 0
       = 0.5 × [10800/3 + 32400/4 - 0/6]
       = 0.5 × [3600 + 8100]
       = 5850

Leaf weights (regularized):
  w_left = -G_L/(H_L+λ) = -180/(2+1) = -60
  w_right = -G_R/(H_R+λ) = 180/(3+1) = 45

Notice: Weights are shrunk compared to standard GB!
This is regularization in action.
```

**Why Second-Order (Hessian) Helps:**

```
First-Order Only (Standard GB):
  - Knows direction to move (gradient)
  - Doesn't know curvature
  - May take too large or too small steps
  
  Analogy: Walking in fog, you know uphill/downhill
           but not how steep

Second-Order (XGBoost):
  - Knows direction (gradient)
  - Knows curvature (hessian)
  - Can take optimal step size
  
  Analogy: Walking with a detailed map showing
           both direction and steepness

Result: Faster convergence, better optimization!
```

**Regularization Effect:**

```
Without Regularization (λ=0, γ=0):
  Tree 1: Large weights [-90, 60]
  Tree 2: Large weights fitting noise
  ...
  Result: Overfitting

With Regularization (λ=1, γ=0.1):
  Tree 1: Shrunk weights [-60, 45]
  Tree 2: Only created if gain > γ
  ...
  Result: Better generalization!
```

### XGBoost Objective Function

The complete objective XGBoost minimizes:

```
Obj = Σ L(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) + Σ Ω(fₜ)
      ↑                ↑
   Training Loss    Regularization

Where:
  L(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) = Loss function (MSE, log loss, etc.)
  
  Ω(fₜ) = γT + ½λΣ(wⱼ²) + αΣ|wⱼ|
          ↑      ↑           ↑
        complexity  L2       L1
        penalty    Ridge    Lasso

Parameters:
  T = number of leaves in tree
  wⱼ = weight of leaf j
  γ (gamma) = minimum loss reduction (complexity cost)
  λ (lambda) = L2 regularization
  α (alpha) = L1 regularization
```

**Breakdown:**

```
γT: Penalize tree complexity
  - Larger γ → fewer, simpler trees
  - Prevents growing unnecessary leaves
  - Acts as pre-pruning

½λΣ(wⱼ²): L2 regularization (Ridge)
  - Shrinks all weights toward zero
  - Smooth effect
  - Preferred for correlated features

αΣ|wⱼ|: L1 regularization (Lasso)
  - Can make some weights exactly zero
  - Sparse solutions
  - Feature selection effect
```

## The Mathematical Foundation

### 1. Second-Order Taylor Expansion

The key mathematical innovation in XGBoost:

**Standard Gradient Boosting (First-Order):**
```
Uses linear approximation:
L(y, F + f) ≈ L(y, F) + ∂L/∂F × f

Only considers gradient (slope)
```

**XGBoost (Second-Order):**
```
Uses quadratic approximation:
L(y, F + f) ≈ L(y, F) + gᵢf + ½hᵢf²

where:
  gᵢ = ∂L/∂F  (first-order gradient)
  hᵢ = ∂²L/∂F² (second-order gradient, hessian)
```

**Why This Matters:**

```
Example: Finding minimum of f(x) = x²

First-order (Gradient Descent):
  x_{t+1} = x_t - η × 2x_t
  
  Problems:
  - Need to tune learning rate η
  - Many iterations needed
  - May oscillate

Second-order (Newton's Method):
  x_{t+1} = x_t - (2x_t)/(2)
          = 0 (exact answer in 1 step!)
  
  Benefits:
  - Optimal step size automatically
  - Faster convergence
  - Better for non-linear functions
```

**For XGBoost:**

```
Objective for tree t:
Obj^(t) = Σᵢ [gᵢfₜ(xᵢ) + ½hᵢfₜ²(xᵢ)] + Ω(fₜ)

where:
  gᵢ = ∂L(yᵢ, F^(t-1))/∂F^(t-1)
  hᵢ = ∂²L(yᵢ, F^(t-1))/∂F^(t-1)²

This is minimized to find optimal tree!
```

### 2. Gain Calculation (Split Finding)

For a potential split, XGBoost calculates:

```
Gain = 0.5 × [G_L²/(H_L+λ) + G_R²/(H_R+λ) - (G_L+G_R)²/(H_L+H_R+λ)] - γ

where:
  G_L = Σ(g for samples going left)
  H_L = Σ(h for samples going left)
  G_R = Σ(g for samples going right)
  H_R = Σ(h for samples going right)
  λ = L2 regularization
  γ = complexity cost
```

**Interpretation:**

```
G_L²/(H_L+λ): Score of left child
G_R²/(H_R+λ): Score of right child
(G_L+G_R)²/(H_L+H_R+λ): Score of parent (no split)

Gain = improvement from splitting
       - regularization penalty

If Gain > 0: Split improves model → accept
If Gain ≤ 0: Split doesn't help → reject (pruning!)
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Parent node: 100 samples
  G_parent = 50, H_parent = 100
  
Split at x ≤ 5:
  Left: 60 samples, G_L = 40, H_L = 60
  Right: 40 samples, G_R = 10, H_R = 40

With λ=1, γ=0:

Score_left = 40²/(60+1) = 1600/61 = 26.23
Score_right = 10²/(40+1) = 100/41 = 2.44
Score_parent = 50²/(100+1) = 2500/101 = 24.75

Gain = 0.5 × (26.23 + 2.44 - 24.75) - 0
     = 0.5 × 3.92
     = 1.96

Positive gain → Accept split!
```

### 3. Optimal Leaf Weight

For a leaf with samples I_j:

```
w_j* = -G_j/(H_j + λ)

where:
  G_j = Σᵢ∈I_j gᵢ (sum of gradients in leaf)
  H_j = Σᵢ∈I_j hᵢ (sum of hessians in leaf)
  λ = L2 regularization
```

**Derivation:**

```
Minimize: Obj = Σᵢ∈I_j [gᵢwⱼ + ½hᵢwⱼ²] + ½λwⱼ²

Take derivative and set to zero:
∂Obj/∂wⱼ = Σgᵢ + wⱼΣhᵢ + λwⱼ = 0
           Gⱼ + wⱼHⱼ + λwⱼ = 0
           wⱼ(Hⱼ + λ) = -Gⱼ
           wⱼ* = -Gⱼ/(Hⱼ + λ)

This is the optimal weight!
```

**Effect of Regularization:**

```
Without regularization (λ=0):
  w = -G/H
  
  Example: G=-100, H=10
  w = -(-100)/10 = 10 (large weight)

With regularization (λ=10):
  w = -G/(H+λ)
  
  Example: G=-100, H=10
  w = -(-100)/(10+10) = 5 (shrunk weight)
  
Regularization prevents extreme weights!
```

### 4. Gradients and Hessians for Different Loss Functions

**Squared Error (Regression):**
```
Loss: L = ½(y - F)²

Gradient: g = ∂L/∂F = F - y
Hessian: h = ∂²L/∂F² = 1

Example:
  y = 10, F = 12
  g = 12 - 10 = 2
  h = 1
```

**Logistic Loss (Binary Classification):**
```
Loss: L = -[y·log(p) + (1-y)·log(1-p)]
      where p = σ(F) = 1/(1+e^(-F))

Gradient: g = ∂L/∂F = p - y
Hessian: h = ∂²L/∂F² = p(1-p)

Example:
  y = 1, F = 0.5
  p = σ(0.5) = 0.622
  g = 0.622 - 1 = -0.378
  h = 0.622 × 0.378 = 0.235
```

**Why Hessian is Useful:**

```
For regression (h=1):
  All samples weighted equally
  
For classification (h=p(1-p)):
  h is small when p ≈ 0 or p ≈ 1 (confident)
  h is large when p ≈ 0.5 (uncertain)
  
  Effect: Focus more on uncertain samples!
  This is automatic importance weighting
```

### 5. Column Subsampling

XGBoost borrows this from Random Forest:

```
colsample_bytree = 0.8 means:
  Each tree uses random 80% of features
  
Benefits:
  1. Reduces overfitting
  2. Speeds up training
  3. More diverse trees
  4. Implicit feature selection
  
Example with 10 features:
  Tree 1: uses features [0,1,3,5,6,7,8,9]
  Tree 2: uses features [0,2,3,4,5,7,8,9]
  Tree 3: uses features [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9]
  
Each tree learns different patterns!
```

### 6. Handling Missing Values

XGBoost has a clever way to handle missing data:

```
For each split, try both directions for missing values:
  1. Send missing → left child
  2. Send missing → right child
  
Choose direction that gives better gain!

This learns optimal default direction automatically
No need to impute missing values!
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through a complete example of **regression with XGBoost**:

### The Data

```python
import numpy as np

# Create non-linear data: y = x² + noise
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.linspace(-3, 3, 200).reshape(-1, 1)
y = X.ravel() ** 2 + np.random.randn(200) * 0.5

# Split train/test
X_train, X_test = X[:150], X[150:]
y_train, y_test = y[:150], y[150:]
```

### Training the Model

```python
from xgboost_scratch import XGBoost

# Create XGBoost model
model = XGBoost(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=4,
    reg_lambda=1.0,  # L2 regularization
    gamma=0.1        # Complexity penalty
)

# Train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**What happens internally - Iteration 0**:

```
Initialize:
  base_score = mean(y_train) = 3.02

Current predictions (F): all samples = 3.02
True values (y): [9.2, 4.1, 1.5, ...]

Calculate gradients and hessians:
  For squared loss:
  g = F - y = [3.02-9.2, 3.02-4.1, 3.02-1.5, ...]
            = [-6.18, -1.08, 1.52, ...]
  h = 1 (constant for squared loss)
```

**Iteration 1: Build First Tree**

```
For each potential split, calculate gain:

Example split at x ≤ 0:
  Left samples: x ≤ 0
    G_L = sum of g for left = 45.2
    H_L = sum of h for left = 80 (80 samples)
  
  Right samples: x > 0
    G_R = sum of g for right = -45.2
    H_R = sum of h for right = 70 (70 samples)

Calculate gain (λ=1, γ=0.1):
  Score_left = G_L²/(H_L+λ) = 45.2²/(80+1) = 25.2
  Score_right = G_R²/(H_R+λ) = 45.2²/(70+1) = 28.7
  Score_parent = 0²/(150+1) = 0
  
  Gain = 0.5 × (25.2 + 28.7 - 0) - 0.1
       = 26.85
  
High gain → Good split!

Calculate leaf weights:
  w_left = -G_L/(H_L+λ) = -45.2/(80+1) = -0.56
  w_right = -G_R/(H_R+λ) = 45.2/(70+1) = 0.64

Update predictions (η=0.1):
  For x ≤ 0: F_new = 3.02 + 0.1×(-0.56) = 2.96
  For x > 0:  F_new = 3.02 + 0.1×0.64 = 3.08
```

**Iteration 2: Build Second Tree**

```
New predictions: [2.96, ..., 3.08, ...]
New gradients: g = F_new - y

Build next tree on new gradients...
Continues for 100 iterations
```

**After 100 iterations:**

```
Final model:
  F(x) = 3.02 + 0.1×[tree₁(x) + tree₂(x) + ... + tree₁₀₀(x)]

Predictions closely follow y = x²
With regularization preventing overfitting!
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# Predict on test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test R²: {test_score:.4f}")

# Sample predictions
for i in range(5):
    print(f"x: {X_test[i,0]:5.2f}, "
          f"True: {y_test[i]:5.2f}, "
          f"Predicted: {predictions[i]:5.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Test R²: 0.9891

x: -2.70, True:  7.21, Predicted:  7.18
x: -2.40, True:  5.98, Predicted:  5.95
x: -2.10, True:  4.61, Predicted:  4.58
x: -1.80, True:  3.09, Predicted:  3.12
x: -1.50, True:  2.45, Predicted:  2.43
```

### Early Stopping Example

```python
# Train with validation set and early stopping
model = XGBoost(
    n_estimators=500,  # Set high
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=4,
    reg_lambda=1.0
)

# Provide validation set
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
    early_stopping_rounds=20,
    verbose=50
)

print(f"Optimal trees: {len(model.trees)}")
```

**Output:**
```
[0] train-rmse: 2.845123, val-rmse: 2.901234
[50] train-rmse: 0.512345, val-rmse: 0.545678
[100] train-rmse: 0.423456, val-rmse: 0.456789
[150] train-rmse: 0.398765, val-rmse: 0.445123  ← Best
[170] train-rmse: 0.387654, val-rmse: 0.448234
Early stopping at iteration 170
Best iteration: 150, Best score: 0.445123

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the key parts of our implementation:

### 1. Computing Gradients and Hessians

```python
def _compute_gradient_hessian(self, y_true, y_pred):
    if self.objective == 'reg:squarederror':
        # For squared error: L = 0.5 * (y - pred)^2
        gradient = y_pred - y_true
        hessian = np.ones_like(y_pred)
    
    elif self.objective == 'binary:logistic':
        # For logistic: L = -y*log(p) - (1-y)*log(1-p)
        p = self._sigmoid(y_pred)
        gradient = p - y_true
        hessian = p * (1 - p)
    
    return gradient, hessian
```

**How it works:**

```python
# Example: Regression
y_true = np.array([10, 20, 30])
y_pred = np.array([12, 18, 32])

gradient = y_pred - y_true = [2, -2, 2]
hessian = [1, 1, 1]

# Interpretation:
# Sample 0: predicted too high by 2, g=2, h=1
# Sample 1: predicted too low by 2, g=-2, h=1
# Sample 2: predicted too high by 2, g=2, h=1

# Example: Classification
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1])
y_pred = np.array([-0.5, 0.5, 2.0])

p = sigmoid(y_pred) = [0.378, 0.622, 0.881]
gradient = p - y_true = [0.378, -0.378, -0.119]
hessian = p*(1-p) = [0.235, 0.235, 0.105]

# Notice: Hessian smaller for confident predictions (p≈0 or p≈1)
# This means confident samples contribute less to updates
```

### 2. Calculating Regularized Gain

```python
def _calculate_gain(self, gradient_left, hessian_left, 
                   gradient_right, hessian_right):
    def calculate_score(G, H):
        return (G ** 2) / (H + self.reg_lambda + 1e-10)
    
    gain_left = calculate_score(gradient_left, hessian_left)
    gain_right = calculate_score(gradient_right, hessian_right)
    gain_parent = calculate_score(gradient_left + gradient_right,
                                  hessian_left + hessian_right)
    
    gain = 0.5 * (gain_left + gain_right - gain_parent) - self.gamma
    
    return gain
```

**Step-by-step example:**

```python
# Data at node
G_total = 100, H_total = 50

# Potential split
G_left = 60, H_left = 30
G_right = 40, H_right = 20

# With reg_lambda=1, gamma=0.1

# Calculate scores
score_left = 60²/(30+1) = 3600/31 = 116.13
score_right = 40²/(20+1) = 1600/21 = 76.19
score_parent = 100²/(50+1) = 10000/51 = 196.08

# Calculate gain
gain = 0.5 × (116.13 + 76.19 - 196.08) - 0.1
     = 0.5 × (-3.76) - 0.1
     = -1.88 - 0.1
     = -1.98

# Negative gain → Don't split!
# This is pruning in action

# Without regularization (lambda=0, gamma=0):
score_left = 60²/30 = 120
score_right = 40²/20 = 80
score_parent = 100²/50 = 200

gain = 0.5 × (120 + 80 - 200) - 0
     = 0

# Still rejected, but less conservative
```

### 3. Calculating Optimal Leaf Weight

```python
def _calculate_leaf_weight(self, gradient_sum, hessian_sum):
    return -gradient_sum / (hessian_sum + self.reg_lambda + 1e-10)
```

**Example:**

```python
# Leaf with 50 samples
gradient_sum = -100
hessian_sum = 50

# Without regularization (lambda=0)
weight = -(-100) / (50 + 0) = 100/50 = 2.0

# With regularization (lambda=10)
weight = -(-100) / (50 + 10) = 100/60 = 1.67

# Regularization shrinks the weight
# Prevents overfitting to this leaf
```

### 4. Building the Tree

```python
def _build_tree(self, X, gradient, hessian, depth=0, feature_indices=None):
    n_samples, n_features = X.shape
    gradient_sum = np.sum(gradient)
    hessian_sum = np.sum(hessian)
    
    # Stopping criteria
    if (depth >= self.max_depth or 
        n_samples < 2 or
        hessian_sum < self.min_child_weight):
        # Create leaf
        leaf_weight = self._calculate_leaf_weight(gradient_sum, hessian_sum)
        return {'type': 'leaf', 'weight': leaf_weight}
    
    # Column subsampling
    if feature_indices is None:
        n_features_use = int(self.colsample_bytree * n_features)
        feature_indices = np.random.choice(n_features, n_features_use)
    
    # Find best split
    best_gain = 0
    for feature_idx in feature_indices:
        for threshold in np.unique(X[:, feature_idx]):
            # Calculate gain for this split
            gain = self._calculate_gain(...)
            
            if gain > best_gain:
                best_gain = gain
                # Store split info
    
    # If no good split, create leaf
    if best_gain <= 0:
        leaf_weight = self._calculate_leaf_weight(gradient_sum, hessian_sum)
        return {'type': 'leaf', 'weight': leaf_weight}
    
    # Recursively build children
    left_tree = self._build_tree(X[left_mask], ...)
    right_tree = self._build_tree(X[right_mask], ...)
    
    return {
        'type': 'split',
        'feature': best_feature,
        'threshold': best_threshold,
        'left': left_tree,
        'right': right_tree
    }
```

**Key differences from standard gradient boosting:**

```
Standard GB:
  - Uses only gradient
  - No regularization in split decision
  - No min_child_weight constraint
  
XGBoost:
  - Uses gradient AND hessian
  - Regularized gain calculation
  - min_child_weight prevents splits on small groups
  - Column subsampling for diversity
  - Gamma prevents unnecessary complexity
```

### 5. Training Loop

```python
def fit(self, X, y, eval_set=None, early_stopping_rounds=None):
    # Initialize
    self.base_score = np.mean(y)
    predictions = np.full(n_samples, self.base_score)
    
    for iteration in range(self.n_estimators):
        # Calculate gradients and hessians
        gradient, hessian = self._compute_gradient_hessian(y, predictions)
        
        # Row subsampling
        if self.subsample < 1.0:
            indices = np.random.choice(n_samples, 
                                      int(n_samples * self.subsample))
            X_sample = X[indices]
            gradient_sample = gradient[indices]
            hessian_sample = hessian[indices]
        else:
            X_sample, gradient_sample, hessian_sample = X, gradient, hessian
        
        # Build tree
        tree = self._build_tree(X_sample, gradient_sample, hessian_sample)
        self.trees.append(tree)
        
        # Update predictions
        tree_predictions = self._predict_tree(tree, X)
        predictions += self.learning_rate * tree_predictions
        
        # Early stopping logic
        if eval_set and early_stopping_rounds:
            # Check validation score
            # Stop if no improvement for early_stopping_rounds
            ...
```

**Execution trace:**

```
Iteration 0:
  predictions = [3.0, 3.0, 3.0, ...]
  gradient = [2.0, -1.0, 0.5, ...]
  hessian = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ...]
  
  Build tree₁:
    Find best split using gain formula
    Calculate leaf weights
  
  Update:
    predictions = [3.0, 3.0, ...] + 0.1 × tree₁(X)
                = [3.05, 2.98, 3.02, ...]

Iteration 1:
  New gradient = new_predictions - y
  Build tree₂ on new gradients
  Update predictions again
  
...continues for n_estimators
```

### 6. Feature Importance

```python
def get_feature_importance(self, importance_type='weight'):
    if importance_type == 'weight':
        # Count number of times feature is used
        importance = np.zeros(self.n_features)
        
        def count_usage(tree):
            if tree['type'] == 'leaf':
                return
            importance[tree['feature']] += 1
            count_usage(tree['left'])
            count_usage(tree['right'])
        
        for tree in self.trees:
            count_usage(tree)
            
    elif importance_type == 'gain':
        # Average gain when feature is used
        importance = np.zeros(self.n_features)
        counts = np.zeros(self.n_features)
        
        def accumulate_gain(tree):
            if tree['type'] == 'leaf':
                return
            importance[tree['feature']] += tree['gain']
            counts[tree['feature']] += 1
            accumulate_gain(tree['left'])
            accumulate_gain(tree['right'])
        
        for tree in self.trees:
            accumulate_gain(tree)
        
        importance = importance / (counts + 1e-10)
    
    # Normalize
    importance = importance / np.sum(importance)
    return importance
```

**Types of importance:**

```
'weight': Number of times feature is used for splits
  - Simple to understand
  - Can be misleading if splits are not important
  
'gain': Average gain when feature is used
  - Better measure of actual contribution
  - Accounts for quality of splits
  - Recommended for feature selection
  
'cover': Average number of samples affected
  - Measures how many samples are affected by feature
  - Good for understanding feature reach
```

```

### Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy

**Step 1: Start with defaults**
```python
model = XGBoost(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.3,
    max_depth=6,
    min_child_weight=1,
    gamma=0,
    subsample=1.0,
    colsample_bytree=1.0,
    reg_lambda=1.0,
    reg_alpha=0.0
)
```

**Step 2: Tune tree parameters**
```python
# Try different depths and child weights
for depth in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]:
    for min_child in [1, 3, 5, 7]:
        # Train and evaluate
```

**Step 3: Add regularization**
```python
# Try different lambda values
for reg_lambda in [0.1, 1, 10, 100]:
    for gamma in [0, 0.1, 0.5, 1]:
        # Train and evaluate
```

**Step 4: Add subsampling**
```python
# Try different sampling rates
for subsample in [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]:
    for colsample in [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]:
        # Train and evaluate
```

**Step 5: Tune learning rate and estimators**
```python
# Lower learning rate, more trees
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3]
for lr in learning_rates:
    n_est = int(100 / lr)  # Rough estimate
    # Train with early stopping
```

### Performance Metrics

#### Regression Metrics

**R² Score:**
```python
r2 = model.score(X_test, y_test)

Excellent: R² > 0.9
Good: R² = 0.7-0.9
Acceptable: R² = 0.5-0.7
Poor: R² < 0.5
```

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**
```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_test - predictions) ** 2))

In same units as target
Lower is better
Penalizes large errors more than MAE
```

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**
```python
mae = np.mean(np.abs(y_test - predictions))

Average absolute error
More robust to outliers than RMSE
Easier to interpret
```

#### Classification Metrics

**Accuracy:**
```python
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

Simple, intuitive
Misleading for imbalanced classes!
```

**Precision and Recall:**
```python
predictions = (model.predict(X_test) >= 0.5).astype(int)

tp = np.sum((predictions == 1) & (y_test == 1))
fp = np.sum((predictions == 1) & (y_test == 0))
fn = np.sum((predictions == 0) & (y_test == 1))

precision = tp / (tp + fp)  # Of predicted positive, how many correct?
recall = tp / (tp + fn)     # Of actual positive, how many found?
f1 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
```

**AUC-ROC:**
```python
# Threshold-independent metric
# Measures discrimination ability
# Range: 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)

Good: AUC > 0.8
Acceptable: AUC = 0.7-0.8
Poor: AUC < 0.7
```

### Early Stopping

**When to use:**
```
✓ Prevent overfitting automatically
✓ Save training time
✓ Find optimal number of trees
✓ Production models (avoiding over-training)
```

**How to implement:**
```python
model = XGBoost(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.1)

model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    verbose=100
)

print(f"Optimal trees: {len(model.trees)}")
```

**Choosing early_stopping_rounds:**
```
Small (10-20):
  ✓ Stops quickly
  ✗ May stop too early
  ✓ For noisy validation sets
  
Medium (30-50):
  ✓ Good default
  ✓ Balanced patience
  
Large (100+):
  ✓ Very patient
  ✗ May overfit
  ✓ For stable validation sets
```

### Feature Importance Analysis

```python
# Get importance
importance_weight = model.get_feature_importance('weight')
importance_gain = model.get_feature_importance('gain')

# Visualize
feature_names = ['feature_0', 'feature_1', ...]
for i, (name, imp) in enumerate(zip(feature_names, importance_gain)):
    print(f"{name:20s}: {imp:.4f}")
```

**Use cases:**

```
1. Feature Selection:
   - Remove features with very low importance
   - Retrain model with fewer features
   - Benefits: Simpler model, faster prediction
   
2. Feature Engineering:
   - Focus on important features
   - Create interactions of important features
   - Investigate why features are important
   
3. Model Interpretation:
   - Explain to stakeholders
   - Validate domain knowledge
   - Identify data issues
   
4. Debugging:
   - Random features shouldn't be important
   - Expected features should be important
   - Unexpected importance → investigate
```

## Computational Complexity

### Time Complexity

**Training:**
```
O(M × N × F × K × log(N) + M × N × K)

where:
  M = n_estimators
  N = n_samples
  F = n_features × colsample_bytree
  K = max_depth
  log(N) = for sorting features

Breakdown:
  - M trees to build (sequential)
  - For each tree:
    - Try F features
    - Sort values: O(N log N)
    - Build tree: O(N × K)
    - Calculate gradients/hessians: O(N)

Typical:
  M=100, N=10,000, F=20, K=6
  Time: ~5-30 seconds
```

**Prediction:**
```
O(M × N × K)

Very fast!
  M=100 trees, K=6 depth
  Prediction for 1 sample: < 1ms
  Prediction for 1M samples: < 1 second
```

**Comparison:**
```
XGBoost vs Standard Gradient Boosting:
  Similar complexity
  But XGBoost has:
  - Better cache efficiency
  - Parallel feature finding
  - Sparse-aware computation
  - Column block optimization
  
  Result: 10-100x faster in practice!
```

### Space Complexity

```
Model Storage:
  O(M × 2^K)

where:
  M = number of trees
  2^K = maximum nodes per tree

Typical:
  100 trees, depth 6
  100 × 2^6 = 6,400 nodes
  ~50-100 KB (very small!)

Training Memory:
  O(N × F)
  
  Store:
  - Training data
  - Gradients and hessians
  - Tree structures
  
  Typical:
  10,000 samples, 100 features
  ~8-16 MB
```

### Parallelization

**Training:**
```
Limited tree-level parallelization:
  ✗ Trees must be sequential (each depends on previous)
  ✓ Can parallelize split finding within tree
  ✓ Can parallelize gradient calculation
  
Production XGBoost (not our implementation):
  - Parallel feature search
  - Cache optimization
  - GPU acceleration
  - Distributed training
```

**Prediction:**
```
Highly parallelizable:
  ✓ Each sample independent
  ✓ Can evaluate on multiple cores/GPUs
  ✓ Near-linear speedup
```

   - max_depth
   - min_child_weight
   - gamma
   - subsample
   - colsample_bytree

   Best for: Structured/tabular data
   ```

5. **Extrapolation Issues**
   ```
   Trees cannot extrapolate
   
   Example:
   Training: values 10-100
   Prediction: value 200
   Result: Capped at ~100
   
   Solution: Ensure training covers prediction range
   ```

6. **Memory Intensive for Wide Data**
   ```
   With thousands of features:
   - Memory usage increases
   - Training slower
   - Many redundant features
   
   Solution:
   - Feature selection
   - Lower colsample_bytree
   - Use sparse format
   ```

7. **Interpretability**
   ```
   Ensemble of 100+ trees:
   - Hard to interpret individual predictions
   - Feature importance helps
   - Not as interpretable as linear models
   
   Trade-off: Accuracy vs Interpretability
   ```

## Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. **Second-Order Optimization is Key**
```
First-order (Standard GB): Uses only gradient
Second-order (XGBoost): Uses gradient + hessian

Benefit:
- More accurate optimization
- Faster convergence
- Better handling of loss function curvature
```

### 2. **Regularization Prevents Overfitting**
```
Three levels of regularization:
1. γ (gamma): Minimum loss reduction (complexity cost)
2. λ (lambda): L2 penalty on weights (Ridge)
3. α (alpha): L1 penalty on weights (Lasso)

All work together to prevent overfitting!
```

### 3. **Regularized Gain Formula**
```
Gain = 0.5 × [G_L²/(H_L+λ) + G_R²/(H_R+λ) - (G_L+G_R)²/(H_L+H_R+λ)] - γ

This ONE formula incorporates:
- Second-order information (H)
- L2 regularization (λ)
- Complexity penalty (γ)

Beautiful mathematics!
```

### 4. **Multiple Sources of Randomness**
```
Row subsampling: subsample < 1.0
Column subsampling: colsample_bytree < 1.0

Both reduce overfitting and add diversity
Similar to Random Forest strategy
```

### 5. **Early Stopping is Essential**
```
Always use validation set + early stopping
- Finds optimal tree count automatically
- Prevents overfitting
- Saves training time
- Critical for production
```

### 6. **Feature Importance Types Matter**
```
'weight': How often feature is used
'gain': Average gain from feature (best for selection)
'cover': Average samples affected

Use 'gain' for feature selection
```

### 7. **Hyperparameter Interactions**
```
Key interactions:
- learning_rate ↔ n_estimators (inverse relationship)
- max_depth ↔ reg_lambda (deeper needs more regularization)
- subsample ↔ colsample_bytree (both add randomness)

Tune systematically, not randomly!
```
